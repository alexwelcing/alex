## Video as a Service

Video has been a driving requirement and recurring theme for web publishing development since YouTube's acquisition in 2006. Search and social's mutual emphasis on video, now live video, as a cornerstone of success encounters cable and traditional media emergence everywhere beyond the TV. 

Today's media space race has reached escape velocity, showing real mainstream adoption for disruptive content delivery formats. Features available in one streaming service are replicated a quarter later in others, established entities leverage their real estate to further capture customers, and production budgets for original IP are included in marketing releases for startups and studios alike.

Envisioning next-generation capabilities requires delivering on fundamental technical issues for media streaming: faster end-to-end responsiveness, local and cloud computation for augmented reality, and data delivery that takes advantage of the latest in content delivery network distribution + caching. Based on recently tackled tech challenges, the next experiences built could include:

- Olympics events available asynchronously at speeds near live, available globally in qualities ranging from 360p mobile to 8k VR. 
- A show premiere going viral internationally with video on demand clips in social before the episode has finished advertising
- Stars watching and commmenting alongside viewers on their couch at home using augmented reality

Thinking of video today, not just as a technical challenge, but also an empathy imperative to make stories easier to create, share and experience deeply provides inspiration and direction. Storytellers are also technology pioneers, and as a last brief observation, the platform that removes barriers in the way of creators will have both grateful producers and viewers.
