## Health publishing

It does not take much time these days to convince others of the need for professional healthcare analysis. Creating platforms for legal policy analysis as a web service was an interesting work challenge in 2017.

Today, I focus on the entire scope of development around knowledge platforms. Our team's goal is to empower lawyers and healthcare consultants to publish resources driving informed decision making across the entire healthcare ecosystem: 

* state and federal offices, 
* care providers, 
* life sciences companies, 
* insurers, and 
* technology companies.

## AI Interactives

Time moves differently at startups, a phenomena I have observed firsthand at several! Similarly to how the American Kennel Club explains the first adult year of a medium-sized dog is equivalent to fifteen person years, every quarter in startup land is like a year and a half on the outside. In the adtech hub of New York by Flatiron District, dubbed Silicon Alley, this rule could not have been truer.

My role as the only external business development was to present a constantly pivoting artificial intelligence content platform to established publications, and I thrived in these oceans of uncertainty and opportunity. Working a cold lead into embedding greenfield technology for a prestigious publisher like Associated Press shows a receptiveness for new ideas in established industries and the benefit of a small and nimble team capable of mobilizing around individual customers and hypotheses.
